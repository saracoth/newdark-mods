# newdark-mods

Collection of example game modifications for NewDark-engine games (Thief 1/Gold, Thief 2, and System Shock 2). These are simple gameplay modifications for demonstration purposes. Only vanilla game assets are used.

Unless otherwise noted, each mod should work with both original missions and all fan missions.

## Installation

Refer to [Installation and Removal](doc/Installation%20and%20Removal.md) for details.

## The Mods

Each mod lists the files it requires, and possibly optional files you can include or skip. Be sure to put the dml files in the dbmods directory and the nut files in the sq_scripts directory. Refer to [installation instructions](doc/Installation%20and%20Removal.md) for more details.

It is not necessary to install every mod, but you can if you'd like. Feel free to pick and choose any combination of mods you wish.

For curious modders, I'd rank these mods from least complex to most complex, in terms of figuring out the moving pieces and how they work together:
1. Keyring
2. Ghost Mode
3. Minion Summoner
4. Radar
5. Fairy Light

### Fairy Light (Thief 1/Gold/2)

A controllable, movable light. Probably as close as Thief gets to a flashlight mod, considering the way the lighting engine works and the limitations related to that.

For more information or to install this mod, check out the [Fairy Light](doc/Mod-FairyLight.md) documentation.

### Ghost Mode (Thief 1/Gold/2)

Sample, simple mod that allows the player to toggle a status effect with some ghostly properties.

For more information or to install this mod, check out the [Ghost Mode](doc/Mod-GhostMode.md) documentation.

### Keyring (Thief 1/Gold/2)

A quality-of-life mod that automatically selects the appropriate key item for doors, chests, gearboxes, etc.

For more information or to install this mod, check out the [Keyring](doc/Mod-Keyring.md) documentation.

### Minion Summoner (Thief 1/Gold/2)

Sample, simple mod that spawns minions on command.

For more information or to install this mod, check out the [Minion Summoner](doc/Mod-MinionSummoner.md) documentation.

### Radar (Thief 1/Gold/2)

Makeshift "radar" effect that helps find nearby loot or other items of interest. Useful for tracking down those pesky little coins and other hard-to-spot items.

For more information or to install this mod, check out the [Radar](doc/Mod-Radar.md) documentation.
