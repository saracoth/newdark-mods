# Keyring (Thief 1/Gold/2)

When this mod is installed, attempting to use a locked item while you have an appropriate key will automatically select that key. You still need to use the key item on the door or other object, but this saves the effort of scrolling through your inventory to find the appropriate key.

This should work on almost every "lockable" item, including unconventional ones like the elemental ward stones outside the haunted cathedral.
