# Keyring (Thief 1/Gold/2)

When this mod is installed, attempting to use a locked item while you have an appropriate key will automatically select that key. You still need to use the key item on the door or other object, but this saves the effort of scrolling through your inventory to find the appropriate item.

If you have no key, but a lockpick will work, the appropriate pick will be selected instead. Note that FMs and mods may create "advanced locks" with non-standard lockpick behavior. Picks will *not* be automatically selected for such locks.

This feature should work on almost every "lockable" item, including unconventional ones like the elemental ward stones outside the haunted cathedral.

:warning: Some doors and receptacles do not trigger the auto-select right now. This is *usually* limited to things that have special scripted behaviors already, like a safe in the Thieves' Guild original mission.
